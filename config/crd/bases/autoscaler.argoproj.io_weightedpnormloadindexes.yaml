                        Negative by default is true,
                        meaning that if there are negative input values (based on previous normalization),
                        they will be reducing the load index accordingly to their weight.
                        For example - Robust Scaling normalization results in 0 representing a median.
                        Depending on the original source of normalized values, this may or may not be desireable.
                        Set to false to assume replace all negative values with 0.
                        That will prevent load index reductions and it will only go up from positive values.
                        For Robust Scaling normalization, for example,
                        that would mean that only values bigger than the median would have any effect on the load index.
