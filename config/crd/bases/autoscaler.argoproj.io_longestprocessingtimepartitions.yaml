                                  For example, when the shard is represented as a secret with type=cluster label,
                                  the UID of the secret is a UID of the shard.
                                  Meaning that it would change if the secret is re-created.
                                  That's what is meant by "unique" in this context.
                                  When the discovery was external - this may be arbitrary string unique to that shard.
